A commission to fix up and complete a website for a client that needed an informational site to connect with potential clients.

Met with client to discuss the site and determine the scope of work, they had attempted to build a website using the Wix editor. They struggled and wanted me to take over the project to fix up the site. I began work using the wix editor and got a rough draft of the site done pretty quickly using a few of the Wix tools and some javascript added into the site.

They gave me some changes to make including the following:

        "Here are some tweaks I would like to the website.  I have attached my business logo for the home page, and my professional picture for the "About" page.

    Homepage is great, I just need the logo added...maybe in the upper left corner?
    About page: Please add my picture, and move the Hypnotherapy services information to the new page.... (see #3)
    New page, called "Services". On the left side, I need Clients and Services as the title, and the following list:
    I treat individuals, couples and families dealing with:
            -Depression
            -Anxiety
            -Stress
            -ADHD
            -Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder
            -Trauma
            -Womens' Issues
            -Relationship and family problems

    Then plug in the hypnotherapy services info that is currently on the About page on the right side of this page."

After making changes I did some SEO work to make the site more search engine friendly.
